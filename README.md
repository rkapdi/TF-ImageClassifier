This is my first ML application. The web app uses CocoSSD from TensorFlow. CocoSSD is an Object Detection Algorithm. 
An image is taken as an input and the algorithm classifies the object in the image.

P.S: I have not added a loader to the web app so please be patient for the algorithm to classify the object. It should not take more than 3-5 seconds.
